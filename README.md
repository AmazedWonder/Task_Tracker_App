TaskMaster Pro - Your Shortcut to Task Mastery.

This is a To-Do list app project. This project focuses on the development of a simple task tracker application. The task tracker will provide users with the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks, aiding in personal and professional organisation.

### Backend

Installed package.json using the command "npm init" on terminal. The npm init command is used to initialize a new Node.js project and create a package.json file. The package.json file is an essential part of a Node.js project as it contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, description, dependencies, and other configuration settings.

The package.json file is used by npm to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, and other project-specific configurations. It is also commonly used to share information about the project with others who may want to use or contribute to it.

command "npm i express cors mongoose dotenv". The command npm i express cors mongoose dotenv is used to install multiple Node.js packages or dependencies for a project using npm (Node Package Manager). Let's break down each package:

* express: Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a set of robust features and utilities for routing, handling HTTP requests and responses, and managing middleware.

* cors: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows web browsers to make cross-origin requests securely. The cors package provides middleware for Express applications to handle CORS-related headers and configuration.

* mongoose: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with MongoDB by defining schemas and models, and offers features like data validation, query building, and middleware hooks.

* dotenv: dotenv is a module that loads environment variables from a .env file into the Node.js process environment. It's commonly used to store sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, outside of the application code and manage them through environment variables.

When you run npm i express cors mongoose dotenv, npm will download and install the latest versions of these packages from the npm registry and add them as dependencies in the package.json file of your project.
